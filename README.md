# Meet Landing Page â€” Frontend Mentor

## Description

This project is a solution for the [Frontend Mentor | Meet landing page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/meet-landing-page-6d0f8f1e) challenge.

The goal was to build a responsive landing page closely matching the provided design. The project uses semantic HTML, SCSS (with variables, mixins, and BEM naming), and the Red Hat Display font from Google Fonts. The layout and assets adapt to all device screen sizes, and all interactive elements have visible hover states.
